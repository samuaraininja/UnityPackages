Custom: Packages that I've made myself or edited
  - The Area-Zone System is my custom method of handling Camera Movement and Variables that depend on where the Player is in a Scene. It is unfinished and currently a 2D-only system. I'd advise against downloading it in this state.
  - Audio Manager is my current solution for handling Music and SFX within my games. I plan on updating it, but it works perfectly as is, so go ahead and use it if you wish.
  - Editor Shortcuts are any tools I've found or written to make using Unity Editor easier.
  - Group Scene Loading is based on a Git-Amend YouTube video that I've heavily edited for my systems. I'd advise against downloading it in this state.
  - Optional Struct is from this video by artificial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZmWgQ7cLNI)

GitHub: Packages from other people that are available via GitHub that I've packaged to make them easier to import or send to other people.

Project Set Up: My method of quickly setting up all the packages that I use in my projects. You can reconfigure it for your own purpose if you want.

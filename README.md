Custom: Packages that I've made myself or edited

GitHub: Packages from other people that are available via GitHub that I've packaged to make them easier to import or send to other people. 

Project Set Up: My method of quickly setting up all the packages that I use in my projects. You can reconfigure it for your own purpose if you want.

Custom: Packages that I've made myself or edited
  - The Area-Zone System is my custom method of handling Camera Movement and Variables that depend on where the Player is in a Scene. It is unfinished and currently a 2D-only system. I'd advise against downloading it in this state.
  - Audio Manager is my current solution for handling Music and SFX within my games. I plan on updating it, but it works perfectly as is, so go ahead and use it if you wish.
  - Editor Shortcuts are any tools I've found or written to make using Unity Editor easier.
  - Group Scene Loading is based on a Git-Amend YouTube video I've heavily edited for my systems. I'd advise against downloading it in this state.
    - But if you do, you will need:
    - https://github.com/starikcetin/Eflatun.SceneReference.git#4.1.1)
    - Odin Inspector: a paid tool or you'll need to remove the Odin Inspector References by hand. (I plan on eventually making an editor for this.)
  - Optional Struct is from this video by aartificial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZmWgQ7cLNI)
  Thimble is a custom logging tool for Yarn Spinner that I wrote. Instructions are included in the package.
  - UI Tooling is a collection of UI editing tools for stylizing UI objects in Unity.
  - Variable References is a collection of Structs made to hold value references based on this talk at Unite 2017 by Ryan Hipple (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk). Supports Float, Int, Bool, Vector3, & GameObject currently. I plan to add more in the future as they are required by my systems.

GitHub: Packages from repositories that are available via GitHub that I've packaged to make them easier to import or send to other people. 
  - Auto Save saves scenes periodically at intervals decided by you in your project settings.
  - Rename In Bulk allows you to rename multiple GameObject and Assets at the same time
  - A-Star_Pathfinding is, well pathfinding, for 2D games
  - Fungus is an older dialogue system with Unity Integration
  - Yarn Spinner is a popular, more updated dialogue system with Unity Integration

Project Set Up: My method of quickly setting up all the packages that I use in my projects. You can reconfigure it for your own purposes if you want.
